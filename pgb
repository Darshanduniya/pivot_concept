 Request for Server Owner Approval to Install PgBouncer on Linux Machine

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well. As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the performance of Airflow database queries, I would like to propose the installation of PgBouncer on our Linux server.

By using PgBouncer, we can implement connection pooling, which will help reduce the number of open connections to our PostgreSQL database and improve resource management and query performance. This will be particularly beneficial given the volume of queries we process and the growing demand on our database infrastructure.

Before proceeding with the installation, I need to obtain approval from the server owner. Could you please assist me in getting their authorization to move forward with this installation?

I am happy to provide more details on how PgBouncer will enhance our system performance if needed.
